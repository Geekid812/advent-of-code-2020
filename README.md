# Advent of Code 2020
This is my attempt at Advent of Code 2020, except I switch languages every day of the week.

This is my schedule:

- Monday - Python
- Tuesday - JavaScript
- Wednesday - C#
- Thursday - Java
- Friday - Kotlin
- Saturday - Ruby
- Sunday - [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar) (a regrettable decision)
